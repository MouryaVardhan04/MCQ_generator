MCQ,Choices,Correct,Explanation
What is the main goal of machine learning?,a: To perform tasks without explicit instructions | b: To study human cognitive processes | c: To develop computer games | d: To focus on symbolic approaches inherited from AI,a,"The main goal of machine learning is to develop statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, thus performing tasks without explicit instructions."
Which field of study focuses on exploratory data analysis via unsupervised learning?,a: Machine learning | b: Data mining | c: Artificial intelligence | d: Neural networks,b,Data mining is a related field of study that focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning.
Who coined the term 'machine learning' in 1959?,a: Donald Hebb | b: Alan Turing | c: Arthur Samuel | d: Tom M. Mitchell,c,"The term 'machine learning' was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence."
What is the relationship between machine learning and artificial intelligence?,a: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence | b: Artificial intelligence is a subset of machine learning | c: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are unrelated fields | d: Machine learning and artificial intelligence have the same goals,a,"Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence."
How does k-means clustering contribute to data compression?,a: By predicting future outcomes | b: By reducing the size of data files | c: By grouping similar data points into clusters | d: By developing computer vision models,c,"K-means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters, simplifying handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finding use in fields such as image compression."
